# Fibonacci_number
In this repository, I tried to find the nth fibonnaci numbers using two method: Iterative solution and recursive function

# Recursive solution:
I used the recursive function to find the nth number but the problem with this is that for each function call, it adds a  new stack with may take a much resources

# iterative implementation:

using the iterative implementation, I used the concept of memoization (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memoization-using-decorators-in-python)to make sure that if we have the previous result are stored to speed up calculation of nth fibonacci number
